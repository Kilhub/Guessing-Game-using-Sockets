# Guessing-Game-using-Sockets
This Guessing Game uses socket programming for multiple clients to connect to a server and play. Players guess a number based on chosen difficulty (easy: 1-50, medium: 1-100, hard: 1-500). The server tracks tries, calculates scores, and maintains a JSON leaderboard. Players can replay without disconnecting, and admins can clear the leaderboard.
